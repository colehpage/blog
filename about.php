        <p>This is the first iteration of Mercurial Analytics, a public sandbox for <a class="author" href="https://colehpage.github.io" target="_blank" rel="author">Cole Page</a>.</p>
        <p>It is an online platform for him to test and play with various skills, languages, and tools as he learns them. It is both a blog publishing data driven articles as well as a giant digital whiteboard</p>
        <p>The primary responsiblity of data scientists and programmers is to learn. Tools, languages, and methods are constantly changing and each change adds and alters how you approach problem solving.</p>
        <p>Throughout this iteration no work will truly be complete. Many pieces may seem broken, unfinished, or pointless as new skills are learned and pieces added.</p>
        <p>Don’t expect anything to work how you think it should, it won’t, but the data being used as well as the accompanying insights and opnions are real.</p>
        <p>Current work includes topics in Data Science, Machine Learning, Sports Analytics, Python, R, Matlab, C, Javascript/jQuery, PHP, HTML/CSS, MYSQL, and whatever esle interests me on any given day!
        <p>The next iteration may be something wholey different, but for now:</p>
        <p>This is simply a digital notebook, publication, canvas, and autodidact playground.</p>
        <p>Enjoy.</p>
