<p class="article-description">It has been almost a year since I finished Andrew Ng's famous course on Machine Learning. It lived up to it's immense hype and then some, so naturally when I started to get the itch to take a new class I quickly stumbled across his deep learning, 5 course AI specilization track and figured I'd give it a try. Over the next few weeks, in and around my research, blogging, and job hunt I plan to log my progress through the course here in a series of posts.</p>

				<p>It has been almost a year since I finished Andrew Ng's famous course on Machine Learning. It lived up to it's immense hype and then some, so naturally when I started to get the itch to take a new class I quickly stumbled across his deep learning, 5 course AI specilization track and figured I'd give it a try. Over the next few weeks, in and around my research, blogging, and job hunt I plan to log my progress through the course here in a series of posts. If you want to learn more or check it out yourself head over to <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">Coursera</a> and although you need a $49/month subscription you can check out the course with a free 7 day trial before spending the cash, which in my opinion is well worth it.</p>
