<p class="article-description">It's getting late here on the east coast and I just finished watching the defending Eastern Conference Champions rack up their 7th loss of the season and 10th straight game giving up at least 110 points, ratcheting up their Defensive Effiency to an absurdly pourus 113.0, good for the worst in the NBA and on pace for one of the worst of all time. Of course we are only 1/7th into the season, and per-usual the defensive sinkholes that are JR Smith and Kevin Love continue to show zero effort on the defensive end, but there is a bigger and much more important reason why the Cavs are such a joke on defense: LeBron James. In this post I want to walk through the early-season disaster that is Cleveland's defensive effort and see if this is a bit more worrying than the standard "not trying before April" excuse the Cavs always seem to get.</p>

					It's getting late here on the east coast and I just finished watching the defending Eastern Conference Champions rack up their 7th loss of the season and 10th straight game giving up at least 110 points, ratcheting up their Defensive Effiency to an absurdly pourus 113.0, good for the worst in the NBA and on pace for one of the worst of all time. Of course we are only 1/7th into the season, and per-usual the defensive sinkholes that are JR Smith and Kevin Love continue to show zero effort on the defensive end, but there is a bigger reason why the Cavs are such a joke on defense: LeBron James. Yes, that LeBron James, the best player in the NBA with the self proclaimed ability to play every position on the floor at the highest level. Sure, this might still be true on the offensive side of the floor, but using your most recent "agressive LeBron trail-block" video as a metric for his defensive prowess shouldn't be enough to fool anyone with half a brain and their eyes open.
				</p>

				<p>I'm starting to let my anti-LeBron feelings take over a little here so I'll cool it for a second and go back to Celevland's numerous other issues on the defensive end.</p>

				<p>So far this season Cleveland is giving up a league worst 5 more points per 100 possessions (108-113) compared to last season, not a good sign for a defense that was already dropping off in the second half of last season. Cleveland is currently 29th in <a href="https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/opponent-shooting-pct?date=2017-11-10">Opponent Field Goal Percentage</a> as well as 23rd in Blocks and 29th in Steals, showing a complete lack of individual effort across the board.</p>

				<p>The only caveat through these first 12 games, is that I truly believe a majority of these defensive woes come a lack of effort vs. a lack of ability, which makes turning them around a much easier task. If you've any of these early games a recurring theme is the atrocious lack of energy at the start of games. The games they have won have usually involved LBJ taking over late game and barely eeking out a win, but Cleveland currently ranks dead last in both 1st half and 1st quarter points allowed, giving up an astounding 2 points more than the next worst team in the Lakers. I get it, you guys are really really old and the energy just isnt there but if you want any chance of getting back to the Finals this year, pop a few redbulls at shootaround and stop sleeping through the first half or you are going to keep giving up 110+ points to the bottom of the east.</p>

				<p>Okay, back to LBJ! There are a lot of reasons why LeBron has seemingly dropped off so precipitisly on the defensive end, and personally I think all have them come down to effort and lack of killer mentality, the one thing that FOR ME will always keep him out of the GOAT conversation. Jordan, Kobe, Bird, Magic, they had it in droves whether it was the 12th game of the season or game 7 of the finals. LeBron is the most athletically gifted, dominant player this league has probably ever seen, and yet he acts absurdly soft constantly. That's all there is to it.</p>

				<p>Opinions aside let's look at a few statistics. With all his superhuman size and athleticism LeBron has given up 181 FG inside the restricted area this year at a 66.5% clip, good for <a href="https://stats.nba.com/players/opponent-shooting/?Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DistanceRange=By%20Zone&PerMode=Totals&sort=Restricted%20Area%20FGM&dir=1&DateTo=11%2F10%2F2017">2nd in the ENTIRE nba</a> only 4 behind Thaddeus Young. One could argue that his league 2nd in Minutes (4 behind DeMarcus Cousins) and atrocious lack of help defense play a big factor, but when you just stand there, watch, and make this little effort down 6 with 6 to play as the first man back on the break, you don't get an excuse.</p>

							<source type="video/mp4" src="./vid/a6/lebron_effort_indiana.mp4" />
					</video>
				</div>

				<p>Among other telling statistics in the defensive liability that is early season 2017 LeBron James is Opponent Points off Turnovers (effort, effort, effort!) where he ranks 429th out of 430 players, only 3 points behind defensive virtuoso James Harden. Add that to 414/430 for Opp 2nd Chance points, 410/430 in Opp Fast Break Points, and 428/430 in Opp Points in the Paint and you get a league bottom 5 worst <a href="https://stats.nba.com/players/defense/?sort=DEF_WS&dir=1&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&PerMode=Totals&CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*&DateTo=11%2F10%2F2017">Defensive Win Share of -0.2</a>, yes that's NEGATIVE as in "the King" personally detracts from the leagues already worst defense. Granted his fellow Cavaliers JR Smith, Kevin Love, and Derrick Rose also round out the top 5 (with Dallas' Wesley Matthews) but you expect the best player on the planet to at least not make things worse. I mean, no disrespect to Taurean Prince but you're LeBron James, there is 30seconds left in the quarter, you are losing to the Atlanta Hawks and because of your "unreal basketball IQ" you know they are going for the 2 for 1 and you just do everything in your power to let them....</p>

				<p>I might be a hater, but I'm not a total asshole. The Cavs are only 12 games into a season where they brought in 10 new players, lost 8, and only kept 7 so a little adjustment time is warranted, but waiting on IT's return to fix this Defense is not going to cut it. If things are going to change, and I truley think they will, LeBron needs to <u>put forth some effort</u>, plain and simple.</p>
